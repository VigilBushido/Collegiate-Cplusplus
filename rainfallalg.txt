	int years = 0, months = 0, count = 0;
	float rainFall = 0.0, totalRain = 0.0, average = 0.0;
Intro
Prompt user for number of years 
do
input validation
	years cannot be less than 1
if (years < 1)
	
while (years < 1)
Outer loop will iterate once for each year
for (int i = 1; i <= years; i++)
Inner loop will iterate once for each month
for (int j = 1; j <= 12; j++)
Prompt user for the inches of rainfall for month
do
input validation
	no negative numbers for the monthly rainfall
if (rainFall < 0)
while (rainFall < 0)
average total rain fall / amount of months

Display to user the number of months, the total inches of rainfall, and the average rainfall per month for the entire period.
